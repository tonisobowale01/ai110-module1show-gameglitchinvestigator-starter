# 💭 Reflection: Game Glitch Investigator

Answer each question in 3 to 5 sentences. Be specific and honest about what actually happened while you worked. This is about your process, not trying to sound perfect.

## 1. What was broken when you started?

- What did the game look like the first time you ran it?
  
  > I noticed the hints were incorrect

- List at least two concrete bugs you noticed at the start  
  (for example: "the hints were backwards").
  
  > The hints lied to me. The scoring system was confusing and not properly implemented. New game isn't working as intended. Attempts left could be wrong.

**Bug Reproduction Log**

Document at least 3 bugs you found. Add rows as needed.

| Input       | Expected Behavior | Actual Behavior        | Console Output / Error |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Guess of 10 | "Go HIGHER" hint  | "Go LOWER" hint shown  | None                   |
| Guess of 5  | "Go HIGHER" hint  | "Go LOWER" hint shown  | None                   |
| Guess of 5  | "Go HIGHER" hint  | "Go HIGHER" hint shown | None                   |
| Guess of 20 | "Go HIGHER" hint  | "Go LOWER" hint shown  | None                   |

## 2. How did you use AI as a teammate?

- Which AI tools did you use on this project (for example: ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot)?
  
  > I used Claude Code on this project.

- Give one example of an AI suggestion that was correct (including what the AI suggested and how you verified the result).
  
  > The hint functionality properly implemented "Too High - Go LOWER, Too Low - Go Higher". It was verified by testing the functionality in the app

- Give one example of an AI suggestion that was incorrect or misleading (including what the AI suggested and how you verified the result).
  
  > I told it to review and point out the bug in the check_guess function. After reviewing, it recommended more lines of code and complex logic implementation

---

## 3. Debugging and testing your fixes

- How did you decide whether a bug was really fixed?
  
  > The check_guess function bug was fixed by testing both manually and using pytest

- Describe at least one test you ran (manual or using pytest)  
  and what it showed you about your code.
  
  > Guess above the secret -> "Too High", and the hint should point LOWER

- Did AI help you design or understand any tests? How?
  
  > I told it to design a pytest testing all possible conditions that the function should expect me

## 4. What did you learn about Streamlit and state?

- How would you explain Streamlit "reruns" and session state to a friend who has never used Streamlit?
  
  > Streamlit session state refers to the current event. When we do a rerun, we are restarting the event with any modification made from the previous event.

## 5. Looking ahead: your developer habits

- What is one habit or strategy from this project that you want to reuse in future labs or projects?
  
  - This could be a testing habit, a prompting strategy, or a way you used Git.
    
    > Refactor my code files more often.

- What is one thing you would do differently next time you work with AI on a coding task?
  
  > Always ask for a walk-through when asking it to fix a bug so that I can learn what went wrong

- In one or two sentences, describe how this project changed the way you think about AI generated code.
  
  > Always crosscheck generated code. Looking like the answer doesn't always means it is.
